# Erica Kido Shimomoto

e-mail: kidoshimomoto.e (at) aist.go.jp

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Artificial Intelligence Research Center (AIRC), National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology ([AIST](https://www.aist.go.jp/index_en.html), member of the [Knowledge and Information Research Team](https://aistairc.github.io/plu/index.html)).

My research topics involve natural language processing, computer vision and pattern recognition. More specifically, my main line of study is the investigation of subspace based-methods and its applications on word embedding. Recently, I have started to dive into the multimodal world, trying to develop less data-hungry model and/or reduce the computational need of existing models.

I give a brief explanation about my research in the following video: [[YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u-SfMdq5hpA)]

I love seeing computers doing human jobs really well. However, I am even more interested in understanding how they can do such jobs so well. If you cannot understand it, how can you trust it?

I also enjoy developing applications involving robotics and electronics.
